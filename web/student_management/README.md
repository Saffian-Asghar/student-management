    In Budget.js you will be adding text and value for your budget. You will be importing app context and the useContext hook, and pass your AppContext to it - this is how a component connects to the context in order to get values from global state.
    In Remaining.js you will be importing expense and budget from context and getting the remaining value using subtraction.
    In ExpenseTotal.js you will be adding useContext and AppContext. Taking the expenses from state.
    In ExpenseList.js you will be using the map function to display the Expenseitem component.
    In Expenseitem.js you will be importing dispatch from Context, which allows you to dispatch a delete action, creating a function that gets called when the delete icon is clicked.
    In AllocationForm.js you will be creating an expense object, containing the name and the cost. This is what will get dispatched as the payload, and what youâ€™ll use to update the state.
